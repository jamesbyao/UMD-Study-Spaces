**Description of the Project**

This project was created for for our Dynamic Web Applications class at the University of Maryland. Our task was to design and build a web application that runs on a server that solve an information problem. We tried to solve the problem of students on the University of Maryland Campus trying to find  the optimal study location based on various needs. Students, the stakeholders,  are prone to have limited resources in finding the right place to study. This limitation is often due to students not being informed on all of the study locations around campus, some of which remain unnoticed throughout the entire school year. Our application's goal is to enlighten students on different types of study locations so that they may get the most out of their academic college experience.

Our application allows its users to search for a place to study based on the type of environment it is located in, the number of tables it has, noise level, and the time the user is planning on studying. They can allow filter through the study locations based its general location on campus, whether it be North, Central, or South Campus. We also created a rating system where once a user enters their name and a handle, which creates them as a user in our database, they can give a rating to the buildings and this information is also stored in the database.
